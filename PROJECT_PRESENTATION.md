## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

College basketball coaching staffs face a critical challenge: **limited time and resources for comprehensive opponent scouting**. Traditional scouting methods are:

- **Time-intensive**: Manual analysis of game film and statistics
- **Resource-heavy**: Requires dedicated personnel for data collection
- **Inconsistent**: Varies based on available time and analyst expertise
- **Reactive**: Often completed just days before games

Our solution addresses these pain points by providing **automated, data-driven opponent analysis** that gives coaching staffs actionable insights in minutes, not hours.

### Understanding Current Operations
To maximize impact, we're actively engaging with coaching staffs to understand:
- **Current Workflows**: How teams currently prepare for opponents
- **Pain Points**: Specific challenges in data collection and analysis
- **Tool Preferences**: What interfaces and features coaches find most valuable
- **Time Constraints**: When and how coaches need access to information
- **Integration Needs**: How this tool fits into existing preparation processes
